For the majority of the story, the main character is portrayed as an innocent little girl who is in a fairytale, gaining the ability to control the supernatural. However, a twist ending introduces the question of whether Iris had been in a fairytale at all. If noticed closely, the path that Iris bursts out of is actually a road and the bright light she is hit with is the headlights of a car. Furthermore, the transition from a dimly lit environment to the dark dome signifies the change from reality to the mind of Iris moments before her death. The plot makes use of the terms ‘iris’ and ‘stars’ to connect several thematics. Iris, besides being the name of the main character, is also the flowers that the forest contains as well as the resolution of the story when the camera zooms out of Iris’ eye for the reveal. Stars represent the supernatural and the climax in the story when transitioning from reality to imaginary.\n            ")])])],1)],1)},i=[],s={render:a,staticRenderFns:i};e.a=s},vjk7:function(t,e,r){var a=r("4gWC");"string"==typeof a&&(a=[[t.i,a,""]]),a.locals&&(t.exports=a.locals);r("rjj0")("dd7a1be0",a,!0)},zlNc:function(t,e,r){"use strict";function a(t){r("vjk7")}Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0});var i=r("XkLc"),s=r("bIUW"),n=r("VU/8"),o=a,l=n(i.a,s.a,!1,o,null,null);e.default=l.exports}});
