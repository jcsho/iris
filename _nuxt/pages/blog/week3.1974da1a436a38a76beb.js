The beautiful pastel palettes of pinks, purples and blues have a calming and pleasing effect on the eye which we wanted to replicate within the environment of the Star Dome. The Steven Universe backgrounds avoid making the sky look flat by using multiple tones and colours to achieve depth and interest. The colours of the stars are never pure white, but instead match the tones within the scene. We want to recreate this environment within our project to show the audience that our character has entered a different world more calm and auspicious than the previous one. Furthermore, the colour pallet of blues and purples will contrast the chosen colour palette of yellows and browns for the “real” world environment.\n            ")])])],1),a("b-row",{staticClass:"mt-5 mb-3",attrs:{"align-h":"center"}},[a("b-col",{attrs:{xl:"9"}},[a("h2",[e._v("Forest")])])],1),a("b-row",{attrs:{"align-h":"center"}},[a("b-col",{attrs:{xl:"8"}},[a("figure",[a("b-img",{directives:[{name:"b-tooltip",rawName:"v-b-tooltip.hover",modifiers:{hover:!0}}],attrs:{src:"/img/ideation/over-the-garden-wall.jpg",alt:"Over the Garden Wall Forest",fluid:"",title:"Forest Inspiration"}}),a("figcaption",[e._v("Figure 2 - Over the Garden Wall")])],1)])],1),a("b-row",{staticClass:"my-3",attrs:{"align-h":"center"}},[a("b-col",{attrs:{xl:"8"}},[a("p",[e._v("\n                The inital setting was inspired by the forest scenes from the background art in an animated television series called Over the Garden Wall.

Another technique used in Over the Garden Wall backgrounds is the use of blacks and shadows.
