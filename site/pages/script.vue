                    <p>They say a life flashes before one's eye when facing death, but what happens after the flash? Young Iris was walking across the street when a sudden flash of light hits her. Dazzled by the light, she is blinded for a while. When she could see again, she notices a light below her. When looking down, she noticed a glowing box. Feeding her curiosity, she opens the box and day becomes night. Looking further into the box, she finds small balls of lights inside. Iris then decides to pick one up and throw it into the air, creating beautiful stars. Blown away by the beauty she has created, she picks up more, runs around while throwing them up into the air. She continues to create a small universe in her own world. However, we start to zoom out and realise Iris is just a particle of a dot in her own eyes. Weâ€™ve then panned out enough to see Iris was actually killed by something. Hints of what killed her are scattered around the screen, giving the indication the light she saw was actually a car light hitting her.
