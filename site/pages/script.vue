                        A young girl named Iris runs through the forest. She is about to cross a street when a sudden flash of light hits her. Iris is blinded by the shining light and once her vision clears, she notices a glowing box. When she opens the box, the world around her is enveloped in black. Looking further into the box, she finds small balls of light inside. Iris decides to pick one up and throw it into the air, which results in the creation of beautiful stars. Iris loves the way the light looks and creates more. She grabs more balls and runs around throwing them up into the air. Eventually, she creates a small universe in this new world. However, we start to zoom out and realise Iris is just a dot in her own eyes. As the scene zooms out further, Iris’s unblinking eyes imply death. Hints of what killed her are scattered around the scene, indicating the light she saw was actually a car.
