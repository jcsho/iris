                    The concept of stars and the particle effects took a lot of inspiration from the background art in an animated television show called Steven Universe. The beautiful pastel palettes of pinks, purples and blues have a calming and pleasing effect on the eye which we wanted to replicate within the environment of the Star Dome. The Steven Universe backgrounds avoid making the sky look flat by using multiple tones and colours to achieve depth and interest. The colours of the stars are never pure white, but instead match the tones within the scene. We want to recreate this environment within our project to show the audience that our character has entered a different world more calm and auspicious than the previous one. Furthermore, the colour pallet of blues and purples will contrast the chosen colour palette of yellows and browns for the “real” world environment.

                    The inital setting was inspired by the forest scenes from the background art in an animated television series called Over the Garden Wall. The muted golds and browns used to create a warm, yet slightly sinister atmosphere. We wanted to recreate the depth and layers of these backgrounds within our forest by using the same tones and adding lots of foliage, plants and trees. Another technique used in Over the Garden Wall backgrounds is the use of blacks and shadows. Although difficult in 3D settings, we will try and develop our lighting to match the mood of the backgrounds used for inspiration.
