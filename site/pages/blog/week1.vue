                <p>The project began with an impactful visual we all wished to animate: a girl filling the sky with stars and supernovas. We imagined the character lighting up the night sky with explosive celestial bodies and glowing particles. This would give us the chance to experiment with particle effects and allow a lighting artist to challenge themselves with a difficult to achieve dark setting.</p>

                <p>Before creating the story, we brainstormed a few ideas for how the character could be “painting” with stars. Would she have special powers? Will it be a metaphor for painting? To answer these questions, we started to piece together character’s backstory and decided that the “painting” would take place in Iris’s, our main character, imagination. This would allow us to deviate from the realism of of Iris' supernatural powers and focus on creative visual effects instead of exposition to explain her situation. Furthermore, we decided Iris would be portray a shy, quiet, and creative person, who often gets lost in her imagination.</p>

                <p>At some level, we felt like we were bonding with our character, until it was suggested that the animation ends with her death. Despite being a morbid suggestion, killing off the main character would make a more impactful short because it is a distinct contrast from generic fairytales with happy endings and would make a lasting impression on the audience. In addition, we will be able to connect the world inside her brain (her imagination) to the outside world (reality) by transitioning out of the frame. With a solid premise and visuals, our job for the coming weeks would be to flush out the script that will make the audience relate and feel sympathetic to our main character, so that we could deliver the intended visuals with the most impact.</p>
